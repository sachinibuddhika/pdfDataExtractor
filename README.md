# pdfDataExtractor
This is a simple code for extracting data from a PDF converted from a text and text images using python.
I have put sample pdf files for both codes.One for extracting text from a pdf directly coverted to PDF from text.And the other is PDF(An Orginal News Paper) which is a PDF not diretly converted from text,but converted from a image to PDF
